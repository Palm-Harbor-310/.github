# Overview

This repository contains several projects that our dev team has developed so far using Python, Google APIs, Azure cognitive services, Excel VBA, and Open AI APIs. The main goal of these projects is to automate and streamline various tasks related to address lookup, purchase order data entry, and company documentation.

## Projects

- **Address Lookup**: This project consists of Python scripts that use Google Geocoding API and Google Places API to lookup county and zip code information using partial address information. The scripts take a CSV file as input and output a CSV file with the updated address information.
- **Purchase Order Data Entry**: This project consists of Python scripts that use Azure Form Recognizer API to automate purchase order data entry from scanned PDF files. The scripts also use Excel VBA to clean and format the data before importing it into a database.
- **Company Chatbot**: This project consists of a chatbot that uses Open AI APIs to work in the terminal. The chatbot will be eventually trained on company documentation on prem to provide an internal tool for employees to use to ask about company processes. The chatbot uses natural language processing and machine learning techniques to generate relevant and accurate responses.
